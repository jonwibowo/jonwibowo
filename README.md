### **Hello! I'm Jonathan Wibowo**

**Computational Social Scientist | Machine Learning & LLMs**

ðŸŒŸ **About Me**  
I explore the intersection of technology and the social world through data analysis, predictive modeling, and visualization. I turn complex information into meaningful insights, with a strong focus on data quality and understanding. Currently a Master's student in Computational Social Science (MaCSS) at UC Berkele

ðŸ“š **Areas of Interest**

- **Human-AI Interaction**: Exploring how AI technologies influence user behavior and decision-making.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Analyzing text data to understand trends and perceptions.
- **AI Applications**: Harnessing large language models/ vision models to address real-world challenges in user experience, education, and businesses.

ðŸ“‚ **Featured Projects**

1. **[Graduate Data Corps Chatbot](https://huggingface.co/spaces/jonwibowo/GDC_Chatbot)**: Built a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot to help students with project discovery and matching. Find out more about the specifics [here](https://github.com/jonwibowo/GDC-Chatbot/tree/main). 
2. **[LLM-Based Scientific Data Extraction](#)**: Developed a pipeline using LLMs and vision models for scientific literature mining, achieving 90% extraction accuracy and a 30% performance improvement through advanced prompt engineering techniques.
3. **[NLP Sentiment Analysis on Spotify](#)**: Scraped and analyzed Reddit data using BERT models to uncover pain points in Spotifyâ€™s AI DJ feature, providing actionable recommendations.
4. **[Kaggle Bronze Medal](#)**: Predicted problematic internet use based on behavioral data using various regression models, ranking in the top 6% on the final leaderboard.
