### **Hello! I'm Jonathan Wibowo**

**Computational Social Scientist | Machine Learning & LLMs**

ðŸŒŸ **About Me**  
I'm currently a Master's student in **Computational Social Science (MaCSS)** at **UC Berkeley**. I am experienced in analyzing social and behavioral data. I enjoy analyzing complex data, and sense-making to derive meaningful insights. Open to data analyst/ data scientist roles!

ðŸ“š **Areas of Interest**

- **Human-AI Interaction**: Exploring how AI technologies influence user behavior and decision-making.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Analyzing text data to understand trends and perceptions.
- **AI Applications**: Harnessing large language models/ vision models to address real-world challenges in user experience, education, and businesses.

ðŸ“‚ **Featured Projects**

1. **[Graduate Data Corps Chatbot](https://huggingface.co/spaces/jonwibowo/GDC_Chatbot)**: Built a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot to help students with project discovery and matching. Find out more about the specifics [here](https://github.com/jonwibowo/GDC-Chatbot/tree/main). 
2. **[LLM-Based Scientific Data Extraction](#)**: Developed a pipeline using LLMs and vision models for scientific literature mining, achieving 90% extraction accuracy and a 30% performance improvement through advanced prompt engineering techniques.
3. **[NLP Sentiment Analysis on Spotify](#)**: Scraped and analyzed Reddit data using BERT models to uncover pain points in Spotifyâ€™s AI DJ feature, providing actionable recommendations.
4. **[Kaggle Bronze Medal](#)**: Predicted problematic internet use based on behavioral data using various regression models, ranking in the top 6% on the final leaderboard.

ðŸ’» **Skills**

- **Programming**: Python (NLP with SpaCy, HuggingFace Sentence Transformers, BERT), R (network analysis, causal inference), SQL (SQLite, MySQL).
- **Machine Learning**: Predictive modeling, LLM fine-tuning, and hyperparameter optimization.
- **Visualization**: Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, ggplot2.
- **Frameworks/Tools**: LangChain, Pydantic, Optuna, Selenium, Playwright.
